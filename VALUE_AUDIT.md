**Type:** Evening  
**Content:** "No health discussions today. Dashboard shows no symptoms logged."

## Evaluation

### Evening Briefing Criteria Assessment:

| Criterion | Finding | Score |
|-----------|---------|-------|
| **Shorter than morning? (5-10 lines max)** | 2 lines. Yes, appropriately brief. | ✅ Pass |
| **Only includes if worth saying?** | Empty day = acceptable to report nothing. Per guidelines: "Empty evening brief (just 'No updates today') is acceptable." | ✅ Pass |
| **Main value: what Steven said today** | **MISSING.** Content states what did NOT happen ("No health discussions") but omits what Steven actually said. Evening briefs should capture Steven's voice/inputs from the day. | ❌ Fail |

---

## Grade: **60/100**

### Why 60:
- ✅ Correctly brief (2 lines meets evening length standard)
- ✅ Accurate (no symptoms logged, no health discussions)
- ✅ Acceptable empty brief per guidelines
- ❌ **Fails core value proposition**: "what Steven said today" is absent
- ❌ Generic framing — states negatives instead of positives

### What This Means:
The brief is technically acceptable but misses the main point. An evening brief that says "No updates" without capturing Steven's actual conversations/inputs is a missed opportunity. If Steven truly said nothing health-related, that's fine — but the brief should still reflect *his* day, not just dashboard state.

---

## Recommendations

1. **Capture Steven's voice** — Evening briefs should prioritize "what Steven said" over "what didn't happen"
2. **Check conversation logs** — Review actual chat/discussion history for health-relevant comments Steven made
3. **Empty brief standard** — If truly nothing to report: "No health updates from Steven today" > "No health discussions today" (passive vs active framing)
